# NLP- Extractive_Text_Summarization
This repository contains Python code for analyzing text documents using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The main focus of the code is on extracting key sentences from a document based on their centrality within the text.


## Features

- **Sentence Embedding**: Utilizes the `sentence-transformers` library to encode sentences into dense vector representations, capturing semantic meaning.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Calculates the cosine similarity between sentence embeddings to measure their similarity.
- **Centrality Score Calculation**: Demonstrates a method to calculate centrality scores for sentences, though it requires further refinement or an alternative approach for real-world applications.
- **NLTK Tokenization**: Uses the NLTK library for tokenizing the document into sentences.
- **Example Usage**: Includes a sample document and code to showcase the workflow of processing the document and identifying key sentences.
